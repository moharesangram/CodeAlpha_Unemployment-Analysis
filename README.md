CoreAlpha Data Science Internship Task 2 – Unemployment Analysis in India Using Python

# Unemployment Analysis in India | CoreAlpha Data Science Internship

## Project Overview

This project is a part of the **CoreAlpha Data Science Internship**.
The task focuses on analyzing unemployment data in India using Python
to understand trends, patterns, and the impact of different factors
on unemployment rates.

Unemployment is a key economic indicator that reflects the health
of a country’s economy and labor market.

## Problem Statement

The unemployment rate represents the percentage of people who are unemployed
out of the total labor force.

In recent years, especially during the COVID-19 period,
India experienced noticeable changes in unemployment rates.
The objective of this task is to analyze unemployment data
and visualize important trends using data science techniques.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains unemployment statistics of India.
It includes attributes such as:

* Region
* Date
* Estimated Unemployment Rate
* Estimated Employed
* Labour Participation Rate

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is used for analysis
and visualization purposes.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology

* Imported required Python libraries
* Loaded the unemployment dataset
* Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyzed unemployment trends across regions and time
* Visualized data using graphs and charts
* Extracted meaningful insights from the analysis

## Results

The analysis revealed significant variations in unemployment rates
across different regions and time periods.
Data visualizations helped in understanding the impact of external factors
such as the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment in India.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in real-world data analysis
and strengthened understanding of economic data visualization
using Python libraries as part of the **CoreAlpha Data Science Internship**.
